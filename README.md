# Just anotter keyboard

## Why the name

Why the otter? Because it's my totem animal.
And for the rest I have loved the designs of the artist named Lim Heng Swee and his "moody anmials" collection.

## Why another keyboard

Becaus I didn't find exactly what I wanted on the marked. Which is a:

* 44 switch spilt keyboard
* with 2 knobs
* with aligned thumb cluster and columns

## Where does the otter design come from?

Simply from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com)!
